Credit Card Fraud detection Project
The goal of this project is to use machine learning models to predict fraudulent credit card transactions. This system aims to effectively detect fraud using customer transaction data. The project involves preprocessing the data, training various machine learning models, evaluating their performance, and deploying the best-performing model for real-time fraud detection.

Models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting tend to perform better in detecting fraudulent transactions compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Cross-validation helps in achieving a more robust evaluation of model performance. Different threshold values significantly impact the performance metrics, particularly precision and recall.

Deploying a fraud detection system has several ethical implications:

Bias and Fairness: Ensuring the model does not unfairly target specific groups or individuals. Privacy: Safeguarding customer data and adhering to data protection regulations. Transparency: Making the decision-making process of the model understandable to stakeholders.
